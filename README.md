# captain-sim

Captains are the connectors between the DAV network, and our various partners. `captain-sim` is a special kind of connector between the DAV network and a simulated environment which it creates and runs. This environment is filled with virtual drones which the simulation keeps track of, including the conditions of each drone, their locations, heading, battery status, etc. The `captain-sim` can respond to requests for deliveries from users, telling the drones where to fly, when to land, and how to complete delivery missions.
